## Description
For each user to satisfy $-60$ dBm, the required received power (Watts) is:

$Pr = 1 * 10^{\frac{-60}{10}} = 1 * 10^{-9} W$

Transmit Power Required to service this user:

$$Pu = Pr * d^{\alpha}$$

If this transmit power is maintained for 5 minutes, energy consumption would be (Joules):

$$E_c = Pu * 60 * 5$$

$5.3$ Watt-hour of power is used when the access point is ON regardless of users being serviced. This would be $19080 J$ every hour and $1590 J$ every 5 minutes.

Energy harvesting is taken from a normal distribution of a certain mean and variance depending on weather condition. 

As an example, this would be $4.21 mW/cm^2$.
If the panel size is $5 cm^2$, the energy arrival will be:

$$4.21 * 5 = 21.05 mW$$

and also equal to $0.02105 W$ which is $0.02105 J/s$. Thus over the 5 minutes, total energy generation will be $6.315 J$

# Energy Policy Comparisons

![Base Energy Consumption 1590J](./images/ec-highbasic.png)

Access points which do not use any energy consumption policy performs similarly to Access Points that try to service the cheapest users.

![Base Energy Consumption 1000J](./images/ec-lowbasic.png)

When Idle Energy Consumption is low, number of serviced users are affected more by the energy consumption policy.

An Access Point which is powered on has a more significant energy consumption. A energy consumption policy might be to let an Access Point determine when it will be able to service the most users and turn on.

# Load Balancing

The User will connect to the next closest Access Point if the closest one is not available.

If the energy sharing budget is the entirety of the stored energy, the total number of serviced users will be affected by load balancing. This aggressive energy distribution method ensures that the highest ranked access point has the highest amount of energy after each timeslot. As a consequence, the lowest ranked access point will possess the least amount of energy.

# Energy Allocation

Energy allocation is based on a geometric series with the ratio, r.

# Energy Sharing

When the number of users is low, no energy sharing resulted in the highest number of serviced users.
